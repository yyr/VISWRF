VISualize WRF

* NOTE: not usable right please come back soon

* INTRO
if you try to write ncl scripts to plot wrf output, you have to write
awful lot of code again and again. This is a framework to VISualize
WRF follows the rule [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRY][DRY]].

* Dependencies
you need to have ncl and python3 installed on your computer

* how to use
- go to results directory
- create conf.ncl script by calling vw.
  : wv conf
- edit ~conf.ncl~ if necessary

finally call
: vw --help
to see what VISWRF can plot.

* customizations to the plots.

- all user customizations are to be made in the ~conf.ncl~ in the
  results directory.
- each results directory should have a ~conf.ncl~ script
